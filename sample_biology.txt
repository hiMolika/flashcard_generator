Cell Structure and Function

The cell is the basic unit of life. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells. There are two main types of cells: prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

Prokaryotic Cells:
- Lack a membrane-bound nucleus
- Genetic material is freely floating in the cytoplasm
- Examples include bacteria and archaea
- Generally smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells
- Have ribosomes but lack other membrane-bound organelles

Eukaryotic Cells:
- Have a membrane-bound nucleus containing genetic material
- Contain various membrane-bound organelles
- Examples include plant, animal, and fungal cells
- Generally larger and more complex than prokaryotic cells

Key Organelles in Eukaryotic Cells:

1. Nucleus: Controls cell activities and contains DNA
2. Mitochondria: Powerhouse of the cell, produces ATP through cellular respiration
3. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):
   - Rough ER: Has ribosomes, involved in protein synthesis
   - Smooth ER: Lacks ribosomes, involved in lipid synthesis
4. Golgi Apparatus: Processes and packages proteins from the ER
5. Ribosomes: Sites of protein synthesis
6. Lysosomes: Digestive organelles that break down waste materials
7. Vacuoles: Storage compartments (large in plant cells)
8. Chloroplasts: Found only in plant cells, site of photosynthesis

Cell Membrane:
- Composed of a phospholipid bilayer
- Selectively permeable, controlling what enters and exits the cell
- Contains proteins that facilitate transport and communication
- Maintains cell shape and provides protection

Transport Across Cell Membranes:

Passive Transport (no energy required):
- Diffusion: Movement of molecules from high to low concentration
- Osmosis: Diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane
- Facilitated diffusion: Transport via specific proteins

Active Transport (energy required):
- Movement of molecules against concentration gradient
- Requires ATP energy
- Examples: sodium-potassium pump, endocytosis, exocytosis

Cell Division:
Cells reproduce through cell division, which is essential for growth, repair, and reproduction.

Mitosis: Division of somatic cells
- Results in two genetically identical diploid cells
- Phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase
- Important for growth and tissue repair

Meiosis: Division of reproductive cells
- Results in four genetically different haploid gametes
- Reduces chromosome number by half
- Essential for sexual reproduction and genetic diversity
