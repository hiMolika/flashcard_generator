        {"question": "What is photosynthesis?", "answer": "The process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, producing glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water.", "difficulty": "Medium"},
        {"question": "Where does photosynthesis occur in plant cells?", "answer": "In the chloroplasts, specifically in the thylakoids where chlorophyll captures light energy.", "difficulty": "Easy"},
        {"question": "What are the two main stages of photosynthesis?", "answer": "The light-dependent reactions (occur in thylakoids) and the Calvin cycle (occurs in stroma).", "difficulty": "Medium"},
        {"question": "What is the chemical equation for photosynthesis?", "answer": "6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2", "difficulty": "Hard"},
        {"question": "What factors affect the rate of photosynthesis?", "answer": "Light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration, temperature, and water availability.", "difficulty": "Medium"},
    ],
    "History": [
        {"question": "When did World War II begin?", "answer": "September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland.", "difficulty": "Easy"},
        {"question": "What was D-Day?", "answer": "The Allied invasion of Normandy, France on June 6, 1944, opening a second front in Western Europe.", "difficulty": "Medium"},
        {"question": "What were the main causes of World War II?", "answer": "The Treaty of Versailles, rise of totalitarian regimes, economic instability from the Great Depression, and failure of the League of Nations.", "difficulty": "Hard"},

    ],
    "Computer Science": [
        {"question": "What is the time complexity of accessing an element in an array?", "answer": "O(1) - constant time, as elements can be accessed directly using their index.", "difficulty": "Easy"},
        {"question": "What is a linked list?", "answer": "A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, each containing data and a pointer to the next node.", "difficulty": "Medium"},
        {"question": "What are the advantages of arrays over linked lists?", "answer": "Fast random access, memory efficiency, cache-friendly layout, and simplicity of implementation.", "difficulty": "Medium"},
        {"question": "What is the time complexity of insertion in a linked list?", "answer": "O(1) if the position is known, O(n) if the position must be found by traversing the list.", "difficulty": "Hard"},
        {"question": "When should you use a linked list instead of an array?", "answer": "When you need frequent insertions/deletions, when size varies significantly, or when the order of elements changes often.", "difficulty": "Hard"},
