# Photosynthesis Overview

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. This process occurs in chloroplasts and involves two main stages:

## Light-Dependent Reactions
- Occur in the thylakoids
- Chlorophyll absorbs light energy
- Water molecules are split, releasing oxygen
- ATP and NADPH are produced

## Calvin Cycle (Light-Independent Reactions)
- Occurs in the stroma
- Uses ATP and NADPH from light reactions
- Converts CO2 into glucose
- Does not directly require light

## Factors Affecting Photosynthesis
1. Light intensity
2. Carbon dioxide concentration
3. Temperature
4. Water availability

The overall equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy -> C6H12O6 + 6O2
